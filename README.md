# metronomnom

## Metronome for the hungry musician

A live version can be found at [metronomnom.korey.io](http://metronomnom.korey.io). Watch a cookie get eaten as you practice your crazy time signature! How could anyone practice before this was invented?! :P Most of the interesting AudioContext stuff happens in src/services/metronome.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
